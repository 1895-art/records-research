# Analyzing the Role of Model Uncertainty for Electronic Health Records

This repository contains code for the paper ["Analyzing the Role of Model
Uncertainty for Electronic Health Records"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03842)
(Dusenberry et al., 2020).

The code currently contains the layers, models, and train/eval/predict script
used in the paper. NOTE: The code provided here is *not currently executable* due
to reliance on internal Google utilities. In particular, the data processing
pipeline is not included, but has been described in detail in [Rajkomar et al.,
2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07860).
